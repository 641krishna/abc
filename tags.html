        <h1>b tag</h1>
        <p>
            To bold the text in HTML, use either the strong tag or the b (bold) tag.
             Browsers will bold the text inside both of these tags the same, 
             but the strong tag indicates that the text is of particular importance or urgency. You can also bold text with the CSS font-weight property set to “bold.”
            </p>
            <h1>i tag</h1>
            <p>
                The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. 
                The content inside is typically displayed in italic. The <i> tag is often used 
                to indicate a technical term,a phrase from another language,
                 a thought, a ship name, etc.
            </p>
            <h1>u tag</h1>
            <p>
                The <u> tag represents some text that is unarticulated and styled
                 differently from normal text, such as misspelled words or proper
                  names in Chinese text. The content inside is typically displayed
                   with an underline  
            </p>
            <h1>select tag</h1>
            <p>
                The select element is used to create a drop-down list.
                The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input. 
            </p>
            <h1>button tag</h1>
            <p>
                The button tag is used to create clickable buttons on the web page. 
                The difference between these elements and buttons created with the 
                input tag is that you can place the content (images or text) inside 
                the button.
